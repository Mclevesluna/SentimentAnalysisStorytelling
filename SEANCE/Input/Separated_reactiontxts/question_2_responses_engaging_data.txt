Even though I knew that women have contributed nothing less to the world than men already, I still felt quite frustrated when seeing the actual data which is showing the fact that women are contributing more than men in care work, volunteering and farming(which is always recognised as heavy work) while a large percentage of men are still having the stereotype that women are not contributing as much as men.
Viewing these dashboards made me feel positive. The data was well-organized and easy to understand, which gave me confidence in our progress and helped me quickly identify areas for improvement.
Those dashboards made me realize that there is a huge problem with unpaid labor, mostly women who spend their time e.g. on care without any compensation. I have heard similar sad stories like slavery in cobalt mines, and I think those are emerging topics. If those countries want to grow their economy, they have to fight for equality and rightful compensation for work.
They make me feel frustrated and a little bit ashamed as a man, because it's very clear and obvious how unfair is the distribution of carework. Even it makes me feel mad, the natural feeling reaction is kind of neutral because it's not a surprise. I expected it. But with some dashboards I felt more disturbed than with others. The map, was the one which I connected the most.
Glad that this information exists and that the gap is so evident between males and females. Motivated to work to improve this. 
As a woman, it makes me feel frustrated and powerless.  Things should be equal between sexes. 
Viewing these dashboards stirred a sense of concern and frustration. The data highlights a persistent and significant gender inequality that affects women’s lives globally. It’s disheartening to see that despite progress in other areas, the burden of unpaid and informal labor continues to fall disproportionately on women, often without recognition or adequate support.
Unpaid labour has a strong impact in our economies. However, this situation put the women in a difficult situation compare with men which works in paid activities rather than unpaid. Inequality.
