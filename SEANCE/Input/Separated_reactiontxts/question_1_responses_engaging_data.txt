Women are more engaged in care work and farming/food production globally compared to men.
From the data dashboards, I can see important information and trends at a glance. They show key metrics and patterns that help understand how things are going and where action might be needed.
There is not equality in many countries mostly based in Africa, where more and more women works in care often as not paid labour. This trend increase in most of those countires, resulting in even more financial GDP gap of unpaid careworkers. 
I understood that first of all, there's much more hours spend in general on unpaid carework, but what I found annoying, is the huge difference between women and men in this kind of things. Also, what the data dashboards show us is that this issue is not changing, and its even getting worst. 
Women spend high proportions of their day doing unpaid labour, this is not only bad for them but also for our overall economy and society. South America has a consistently high amount of informal care workers through the years. Most care workers are female. There is a lot of missing information for several countries through the years, this makes it difficult to understand the information.
The burden of unpaid work is greater for women than for men throughout the world. While some countries are making progress, in many developing nations, there seems to be little to no improvement. Care work which should be an essential aspect in human development (nurturing and raising future generations) is often undervalued compared to other types of work.  Even food production is done mostly by women. 
The dashboards paint a clear picture of the gender disparity in unpaid labor and care work across different countries. Women are overwhelmingly responsible for these roles, whether it's informal care work, volunteering, subsistence farming, or unpaid domestic labor. The data shows that this imbalance has persisted over time and has even worsened in certain areas, particularly since the pandemic.
This is raw data that you need to use in context as an example of each one of the periods that the dashboard are evaluating.
High woman inequality in the world
Although we seem to progress in terms of equal rights between men and women, the traditional model of women taking care of household chores and childcare persists
