It's how I feel every single day in every single situation, within almost every single relationship and interaction. Only a few people can take me whole.
We are surrounded by silent suffering and should not ignore it, sometimes people only need to be listened to heal
I related it to my father, who I adore but happens to have many of the behaviors described regarding the son. Men who do not feel care and particularly the attentive conversation is their duty.
As a woman who grew up up in the 60s, some  of that traditional roles were expected of you.
I thought about how I often took for granted stuff my mom did for me and my brother growing up, how taxing it must have been for her not only doing a job that society unfairly assigned to her and not my father, but also for not being properly thanked for it, or reciprocated for. 
I'm able to see the reality of a lot of people here. How we stop sharing our personality or really doing what we want based on what we have been taught are "the right things". 
This piece made me think of my grandmothers, currently both alive. I have always looked up to them admire their way o dressing and obsessed with their clothes. In the last three years both of my grandfathers died and from this time i have seen my grandmothers vulnerability flourish in a very sad way. On the other hand this made me think on how unconditionally and with out questioning their thoughts and ways of leaving i love them, but on the other side i constantly find my self trying to change my parents and the decisions they make.
I feel really guilty not to visit my grandmothers more often. 
Off course! I think it’s part of this human experience and the society norms in which we live in. 
I relate to this text because I've had a similar relationship with the person who works in my home in Bogotá. She is someone who is always present in the family and whom we all care for deeply. I feel that she knows all of us very well and is truly a part of our home. However, in the end, we don’t really know her own reality. Someday, I would like to be able to visit her other home.
Yes, as my mom is someone who will spread herself thin in the way Luz does but does not do the things for herself that she does for others. 
yes, I want to give my mom everything she gave me.
I find the text relatable as I'm at a critical stage in my life where I'm faced with societal pressures and biological deadlines. The struggle to balance my personal aspirations with external expectations is a constant dilemma. I often find myself torn between pursuing my career goals and contemplating the sacrifices I'm willing to make for my future. The text resonates with me because it echoes my own internal conflicts and forces me to confront the tough decisions I need to make about my priorities and values.
I didn't directly relate to the text but I felt the need to make my workplace a better place where no one feels this way. 
 I felt I could deeply relate, not in unpaid labor but yes in how one destroys its possibilities of dreaming when it feels like everything is too inhospitable to let you have hope. I could relate by not being good at asking for favors because I get rejected. I feel the author is completely scared of asking for support, especially because she knows that even if she asks for it, she won't get it. I'm deeply scared of rejection and try to avoid anything that will lead me towards being rejected. Even if it's asking my boyfriend to take care of my cat just one day.
This made me question whether I experienced what this piece represents, from both sides of the relationship.
No
a
I certainly did. I have been doing a lot of thinking and introspective seeking on what is the meaning of "work", what is the value of it, when most people are disengaged in their work life and feel like their contribution to human development and scavenger is negligible, yet spend 1/3 of their prime years caring out tasks that give them no joy or fulfillment. It's very sad and what's sadder is there ever-present feeling of inadequacy and entrapment.
I have been on both sides, as a candidate and employer. I have exaggerated and presented as the described posting, is a very unauthentic interaction that we all follow 
I grew up with a Nana and pay a lady to clean my house weekly. This piece made me think about them, about how little I know of their lives and how I would like to care for them more, even if its with attention, details or kindness.
It brings memories of women caretakers in my childhood.
Yes. Made me think of all the seemingly little things that my mom, or I, or my cousins have to do every day that men are not expected to. How when I stand up from the table I instinctively pick up my husbands or brothers or fathers plate, but seldom get mine picked up.
At first I did, but as I kept reading it made me feel like there was not a single thing that she appreciated creating a barrier to connect and relate to it.
I'm a creative my self and i as i read the piece it made me think of a really familiar feeling that i've been having for the las year. I work mainly on paid jobs but constantly encounter my self with clients that don't have a budget, or clients that requiere you to always be available to give the 5 extra miles, clients that don't trust you or question your abilities. This have made me question my own talent an capacities many times, even taking me to extreme thoughts of having a radical shift on my career or even having mental break downs about it.
As a Colombian, it gave an instant feel of “awww” sweet moment because I live this everyday with Alba and really care and love her. It makes me reflect upon the fact that she should feel more appreciated by the family she also sustains, mine. She is my family 
Yes, I feel that we live in a society with certain standards that we think we must meet to be accepted. However, as I have grown, I have changed this perspective and believe that I am now more aware and honest with myself about my feelings, dreams, and thoughts, and ultimately more authentic in my way of being.
In recognising the ways that the women in my life have tended to give more of themselves than they were to receive from others.
I related because adaptability and change are a very important step to to thrive in life.
I relate to this text because I've heard the phrase 'You should feel honored to work here' in the past. At the time, I didn't speak up and express my thoughts, instead choosing to continue with my job. In hindsight, I wish I had spoken up, as it's important to assert oneself and address potentially toxic workplace dynamics
Yes a lot! It made me remember the people in my life to whom I feel grateful and how its always easier to give and very difficult to receive. It makes you think about the people that dedicate their lives to caring about others and sometimes they get lost and forget who they are.
This piece made me feel sad. It brought back memories of my own grandparents, especially my grandmother on my father's side. I can deeply relate to the emotions the author describes. I don't recall my dad ever speaking about his mother with pure love; there was always some underlying disdain.

Did you relate to this text in any way? If so, please explain how:

It reminds me of my grandmother, Tita, and the contempt my father had for her. In my father’s family, people would often call me by the wrong name, confusing me with my older sister, because we rarely saw them. I understand the awkwardness of feeling affection for someone like a grandmother when your parents hold them in contempt. How can you not learn to despise certain things when you see your parents despise their own?

This also resonates with the idea of burdens being passed down and the typical male inability to fully assume caregiving responsibilities, often shifting them onto a woman—whether it's a daughter, wife, or mother.

My dad wasn’t speaking to my grandmother when she died, and she passed away feeling very sad because her youngest son, out of eight children, had abandoned her. Now, I find myself caring for my father, who not only abandoned his own mother but also my mother, sister, and me. Yet, he never acknowledges this abandonment, though he occasionally recognizes that I’ve been supporting him for the past 10 years.

I now have a close relationship with my dad's sisters, whom he no longer speaks to either. (He fights with everyone and resents everyone, including me.) It was they who told me that my dad was the light of my grandmother's eyes, that she never laid a hand on him, and that she loved and pampered him dearly. I have never once heard this from my dad himself.

And a tragicomic story to finalize this:

When my grandmother died and was cremated, my dad was the one carrying the little box with her ashes after the mass. I honestly thought, "WTF? You didn't speak to her for years, resented everything she did, and now you're the one who gets to carry her in your lap in a taxi to my aunt's house?"

When she died, I didn't even know what to feel. I felt sad, but I also felt I didn’t have the right to feel sad because I hadn’t called or visited her as much. We weren’t super close, and I was so biased by my dad's perception that I felt guilty. I think women are great at feeling guilty. Do men feel guilty as often? I honestly doubt it.
This piece made me consider my own relationship with my family, and the fact that I do not take care of my parents and grand parents as much as they took care of me during my whole childhood. I live far from them and am not very present, especially to help my grand mother who is aging and experience difficulties to move.
No, but it reminds me of my mother a little bit. The endless work and love she spends every single day, from since I was a baby and even still today, she is helping me with so many things, she cooks for the entire family, and for way too long I took her care and labour for granted. Only since I became more adult I understand how much work and time she sacrificed for our family, and I started to become very grateful of this. 
s
I have seen some aspects of this playbook in my own culture and society and it affected my family closely
I have idealized things that when achieved are very different from what I have imagined, which is sad however we should learn from these experiences and move on
I thought about how many generations would it take for it to become a less relatable piece, my mother is not someone who cooks but the feelings portrayed, I am sure she has felt, I don't know if I will relate to them when I have my own family completely, or if my daughter (if I eventually have one) will. 
No
Just made me think about my mother-in-law, who is one of the smartest most go-getting person I know, but who decided to stay home and take care of her kids during their youth, is probably also the least employable person i know. Sad.
I did. As I mentioned before this is what I have read in most job postings. 
This made me think of Gloris, the lady that took care of me when i was a kid. She was with us for 11 years and when she left I suspect is the first time i was depressed in my life. She left i would only asked for food cooked by her or i would refuse to eat it. My mom, trying desperate moves tried to copy her ways of cooking, but it was never the same. 
Definitely hurts and makes me feel
A bit uncomfortable to know that this is how my mom feels in her everyday life. Must be exhausting to feel this way every day… makes me want to take care more of my mom. 
I believe there have been situations in my life or people with whom I have felt like this woman who feels responsible for carrying the weight of others. I don’t identify with her entirely, but I do think there have been times when, for one reason or another, I ended up putting others above myself, which can lead to harming oneself both physically and emotionally.
YES. It amplifies the strong feelings I monitor of the inherent loneliness and destructive patterns that modern life enables and forces in the workplace, and that we as result carry out of the workplace. Donning a sort of mask that we must employ to trudge through the banalities of everyday working day life.
Not really.
I deeply relate to this text because I have my own 'Luz' in Elvi, who raised me from birth until I left my parents house at 26. Elvi, who has no biological children, has been like a mother to me, and I'm her only 'daughter.' Now retired in Zipaquira, she visits me monthly. However, I often wonder what Elvi's life would be like if she had access to equal opportunities and a chance at a better future. This text resonates with me as I reflect on Elvi's sacrifices, dedication, and the what-ifs of her life.
I don't feel at all related to this text. I am a very caring person with my grandparents and I would care for them forever, I am very grateful for them and wouldn't imagine having this dilema if I understood correctly. 
This makes me wonder if men ever feel this way? Do they carry this much emotion? Do they feel this guilty when they think about their needs? Is it a female thing to be unable to ask for what makes you feel good and safe?
This piece made me wonder whether people experience similar unfairness in my relatives, and what I should do to support them the same way they support me.
I can relate somehow, since I've been to Colombia myself and stayed with wealthy families, who all had a maid to clean and cook for them. Those maids that I met were extremely loving and caring, but I do not know under which circumstances they actually live, and how they are managing to have their own family to take care of plus another persons family at the same time. I also do not know how well they are paid, and how valued and appreciated their work is with the families they help in. 
As someone who has been recently thinking of spicing up my Linkedin profile and has been on job hunts I felt it completely relatable. Even in my actual job it made me question many of the unrecognized non traditional things I do daily that don´t even make part of the job description. Specifically when an ex boss asked me to take his daughter to the dentist.
I relate in the sense that if it was up to me, I would start decluttering and organizing.
As a creative, freelance women that struggles with organize her time an finances, my wellbeing has been a real challenge for the last year. It's paradojical that one of my greatest accomplishments in my adult life has been leaving my parents house and becoming a independent person. At the same time it has been some of the most challenging times of my life, trying to succeed and at the same becoming a care taker (mother) for my self. 
I could with certain sentences. Like I read and could relate to parts but not as much as the previous ones.
Yes. I can relate to the feeling of never being good enough for someone, also for the people that are closest to you. I can relate how this burns you out from inside until you become empty, and fall into a deep dark hole of depression, because I experienced both these things, too. I can relate to how she is given stupid tasks like counting pages; I can relate to how she is being objectified, as I was, too, in the past. 
At some point starting  professional life, young women were not taking seriously, There was the assumption women looked for  jobs just to find a husband. 
Completely. Im also Colombian, and I also had a beautiful Luz in my life. Actually two. One even slept in my house from Sunday to Saturday.

This also makes me think of the people that take care of kids in order to pay someone to take care of their kids. I grew up like this (me being one of the privileged kids that was always being taken care of) and sometimes questioning where were the families of the loving people that took care of me? As I grew started growing up, this became an awkward feeling so I moved on to think of other things. I felt guilty and sorry for them. 

I’m also embarassed to accept that once, a German guy said that we had modern slavery in Colombia because we have maids and servants, he used those words (in my defense, he had a horrible attitude and he spoke with a lot of superiority). I told him he didn’t understand, he hadn’t lived there, and that the compromise behind this is helping their families and giving them opportunities for the later generations to have more decent jobs. I can’t believe I actually thought it was normal and a “job” for a person to take care of me 14/7. Sleep in my house. Cook my food, play with me, take my dog out to the park, clean the whole house, love me, mediate in my fights with my sister, make sure I wouldn’t watch tv when my mom wasn’t around. I would even go sleep in her bed and wake her up when I had nightmares and my mom told me to go back to my bed. How in the world do we normalize this?
no
I like analogue photos, I also really like the colors. I like everyday empty sets. This are the kind of photos I like to take and I hate that companies want ownership from us.
