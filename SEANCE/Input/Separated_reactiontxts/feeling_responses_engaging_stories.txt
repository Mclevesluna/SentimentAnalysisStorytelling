Understood. Uncovered. Touched.
I feel sorry for this woman, and I would like to hear her and help her somehow. Show her some understanding and empathy 
A long the piece I had different feelings, in the beginning I felt the same contempt for Nana Jean the narrator has, but as it progressed I felt guilty, pity and towards the end angry even outraged because of the injustice of her ending. Particularly towards the son.
Negative. There seem to be no way out. No dreams are viable
Thought it was shocking. Made me sad and angry, but also surprised at how well the author was able to convey such deep, sad emotions in such a seemingly delicate, cutesie way.
It made me feel sorry for the person and angry at whatever is making her feel like this. 
Negative 
Makes me reflect upon the times when I act in pilot mode, making using of my patterns in daily life that not always are  in My best interests and being oblivious to my own feelings and well being. 
This piece brings up a lot of feelings. On one hand, it makes me feel warm and admire Luz for her kindness, dedication, and all the love she’s given. On the other hand, it makes me sad and uneasy because it shows how women like her often go unnoticed and are expected to stay in the background, without much recognition or a voice of their own. 
Negative in the empathy I feel for someone like this, as I know people close to me in my life who exhibit this behaviour, but positive in the sense that it is a good reminder to take care of oneself and check in with yourself.
Positive reaction, made me understand that my mom did everything for me and I am very lucky  
The piece had a negative impact on me because it highlighted the stark reality of women's struggles, particularly in regards to their autonomy, desire, and bodily ownership. It's a harsh reminder of the societal expectations and pressures that women face, and the ways in which their needs and desires are often marginalized or ignored.
The piece made me feel fortunate about my job and very frustrated knowing that some people have to work under such harsh conditions.
I felt tenderness from the title and the first paragraph. Found it to be very cute and made me blush a bit. From the second paragraph onward, I cried the whole time. I felt so sad, I could relate to the feeling so much. I also felt glad I read it. I would like to write like this. 
This piece made me feel sorry for people experiencing this, and worried I may have contributed to it.
It made me feel uncomfortable and disconnected, and also a bit guilty. 
Uncomfortable, because it should not be, that a person does not own their own body for themselves, a body which actually is owned, ruled, driven and governed by others (other peoples needs), ignoring the persons own needs. It's like not existing for yourself. 
Disconnected, because it is hard to relate to the persons position. 
And guilty, because I can not relate, because this should not be, I should do something against this, but I am not, and I would not know how to.

Relatable. Avant-garde. Current. 
I feel deceived, frustrated and guilty. We should reflect more on day to day things we repeat without thinking
This piece made me feel sad, guilty and made me ponder on my own relationship with my nana.
Positive. Although the contrast between dark and light, the story has a nice energy. Luz embodies those people we depende on through our lives. She seems to be content, but she is undervalued. 
Angry, mostly. Angry at the father who is unapologetic for avoiding to care for his own mother. Angry that the burden of this very important thing automatically fell on the women of the family. Empathetic towards the fear of having to take care of somebody. In awe of the stepmother who owned the job with love and grace.
First it made me feel sad for her, but then it made me feel frustrated because most of her talk is negative and not being able to appreciate some of her body parts, .  
negative 
It’s mixture of melancholy, guiltiness, and empathy. It makes me reflect on how much Alba gives to me, and the positive impact that I also want to be in her life and get to know her the way she has gotten to know me. 
It’s frustrating and angering to see how the pressure to conform to societal expectations can lead to emotional strain and a sense of neglect, suppressing the true feelings and avoiding being authentic due to fear. 
Negative
neutral 
I feel frustrated by this piece, not due to the experiences, but because she appears to lack the empowerment to speak up and advocate for herself. It's troubling to witness her life passing by without her expressing her own needs and desires
It made me feel nostalgic and reflect on the people in my life who always give without expecting anything in return. I am very grateful for them and would love to be as much a part of their lives as they are of mine.
This piece made me feel wierd and a bit sad and nostalgic. It brought back memories of my own grandparents, especially my grandmother on my father's side. I can deeply relate to the emotions the author describes. I don't recall my dad ever speaking about his mother with pure love; there was always some underlying disdain. I liked my grandmother but somehow I know I mimicked many behaviors my dad towards her. Actually it was my mom (my parent divorced when I was 4) who would encourage my sister and me to call her and love her. Not my dad. 
This piece made me feel sorry for Crazy Nana Jean, angry at her son for his ungrateful behavior.
It made me feel sorry and angry. 
This should not be, a persons work should be recognised, even valued, especially when it becomes such a sacrifice to this persons own wishes. I want this person's labour to be recognised. I do not understand why this work is not recognised! Why is society like this, why do we not all take care of each other amongst us

Sad. Indignant. Compassionate.
Is sad to see and think how many people in the good intention of giving joy to others end up sacrificing their own, 
This piece made me feel, outrage, anger and indignation.
Upset at the lack of awareness / responsibility of the son towards this own family members.Taking women's role for granted, 
Thought it was clever. Made me sad how deciding to be a stay at home mom for a while usually comes at the expense of a professional career, despite being probably the hardest job ever.
It made me feel surprised and intrigued. Reading the text it felt like most of the companies requests for candidates. It made me wonder if I have ever done it, and if there has been a company that has done that for me.
neutral, nostalgic, thoughtful
I didn’t feel quite reflected. Maybe because I am selfish or maybe because I don’t have kids. Although with my mother I have felt this one time or another in my life. Feelings of trying to help her out as she has done so herself. It actually reminds me most of the selfless love my mother always provides. She is the tired one… 
It generates a negative reaction of fatigue, exhaustion, and self-neglect. Perhaps this person is very good to others but selfish with herself.
Negative
positive reaction because it talks about a topic that is very undermined in our current civilization.
Reading this piece evoked a strong negative emotional response in me. I felt a deep sense of discomfort, sadness, and guilt. The vivid portrayal of Luz's isolation and exploitation hit close to home, as I recognized the harsh reality of societal norms that perpetuate such injustices in Colombia. The knowledge that I am part of a society that has normalized and tolerated this kind of treatment towards domestic workers like Luz filled me with regret and frustration. The text's honest depiction of her loneliness and disempowerment made me question my own complicity, leaving me feeling somber and reflective.
I feel frustrated because I feel it's a dilema between taking care for the woman who raised your father and not tolerating her. I don't know if I didn't understand the text but I felt it was a bit ungrateful. 
I felt empathy and it makes we wonder if I feel like that often and I'm not a mom, how can mom's and care-takers manage?
This piece made me empathize with the author, and sorry that they are carrying so much burden and no receiving back similar help.
It made me feel a little bit sad, but overall I feel not as negative as towards the other stories in this one. 
I am glad, that the writer recognised the carers labour and sacrifices, and also their circumstances of living. It is humane of the writer to wish for this person to have more of their own life, instead of sacrificing it all for others. I see that the writer sees the carer on an equal level of him/herself, more as a friend, and not on a lower level or as a servant. 
But it makes me sad, that this wish does not seem to become true, of both of them being equal. 
I felt a contradiction, uncomfortable because some are even in my own linkedin but I questioned them and see their exaggeration.
Negative. I like structure, organized environments
negative, sad, related 
Honestly, I felt confused. I felt like someone that has too many thoughts at once was putting them all quickly on paper.
It makes me angry that society is trying to put their ideals onto others, regardless of that this person for themselves might want. Especially in this male dominated context, "you should wear make-up; who will marry you", and seing her as an object rather than the person she is. 
Negative. I found the story suffocating and frustrating
I felt embarrassed. I find it so embarrassing to have this kind of labor in Colombia and most people think it's normal. I also felt love because this women who raised us can be the most loving ever. But I got to be raised by someone else's mother who didn't get to raise her own children and she had to work far away form home so she could pay for someone else to take care of her kids. It's very messed up. 
I found it confusing. Didn't really understand it
Loved it. Beautiful pictures. It felt like a short documentary. I felt angry because I feel angry everytime big companies talk about ownership but I think they don't do reverse ownership. We as employees are so easy to replace.
