It conveys the struggles of a strong, I dependent woman, to fit into a small box of societal expectations that can only be achieved by cutting her wholeness into digestible chunks for others to understand 
The reflection and relief of a woman who has and carries a heavy emotional burden, who places herself in second place behind everyone else. Someone with low self-care and self esteem
Crazy Nana Jean is the story of a woman who gave her life for her family in every way expected of her, but receives not only nothing in exchange, but even negative feelings. Not even her son, who received most wants to turn the tables and take care of her. The duty falls on the shoulders of those who least "owe" her. It talks about the chain of care, how this duties endlessly avoid some and is demanded of the same ones, who will rarely be cared for.
Frustration with assigned / expected role. "Women belong in the kitchen"-
How taxing giving care is on the caregiver by personifying the expectation that “women belong in the kitchen”
From this piece I interpret how censored and repressed she is by not been able to be herself. 
This piece describes the complex family relations, in which blood ties are really complex and not alway work as they should. I also can interpret that the things that parents think are good for their kids and their future are not always the most appropriate.
For me it’s a toy kitchen is our mechanical and unconcious way of self sabotaging and not believing in being vale to accomplish our goals of wished in any part of life. A way of not considering your innate feelings and putting under rug, led by social standards. Also for me shows our natural way for is to traicionar ourvselves knowing we know better and not being honest With ourselves in the world.  
The piece reflects a deep and familiar connection to the role that women like Luz play in many Latin households. It touches on the complex dynamics where these women are seen as essential yet often undervalued members of the family. Luz is a source of warmth, kindness, and light, despite the darker, colder environment she lives in. She is a constant presence, expected to fulfill her duties without much recognition or voice.
Luz is a woman who puts others before herself. She spreads herself thin, extending herself (branches of a tree) supporting others (the leaves) who can thus bud and grow, but does not give herself the support she needs from within (the tree).
This piece really touched my heart, I thought about my mom. What I understood from this  text was that mothers generally take care  of their families without any hesitation. They do anything for you without remorse or regrets. 
I understand from the piece the immense burden women have to bear in life, how they have to share and give all that is theirs to others, especially if they have children. What resonates most shockingly is the line 'the sex that gives pleasure that is not always mine.' This statement is both true and harsh, highlighting the painful reality that women often prioritize others' needs and desires over their own.
I understood the text describes a person who is burdened by her job in the kitchen, where her well-being, reasonable work hours, fair pay, and a healthy environment are neglected, with the sole focus on delivering results. She never stops, and even when she does, she can't engage in anything else due to the toll the job takes on her. 
A very beautiful way of writing from a naive and metaphorical perspective. You draw concrete connections between cooking as a tool to exemplify destruction of one's self-confidence. The kitchen is one of the main places of unpaid labor, care economy and also the place where food and nurturing comes out. But it's also full of dangerous tools that can be used to cut, burn, blend...
It is depicting work often expected from women in their social life, and associating it with parts of their body. Doing so, the piece emphasizes how their whole being is dedicated to others and performing tasks that are often not acknowledged, appreciated and rewarded.
Being caught inside a body that is not yours anymore, but others 
a
The pressure of an imperfect, broken society on the workforce. The subtle, between the lines hint to a culture of veiled exploitation, where the balance work-life is nothing but an illusion and we all are nothing but a means to the success of a selected few.
The harsh truth behind the process of job hunting and recruiting can be extrapolated to other areas of life. How do we try to get different results by doing the same
This piece is about all of the woman the nanas, the maids and paid care workers who sacrifice their own life, children and joy to give their care to another family probably because of economic hardships. How they are endlessly given but do not have time, space or energy to tend their own needs or those of their families.
A nice woman who others depend on her. Her life seems to be that of service.
How the burden of caregiving disproportionately falls on women; how men are not judged for avoiding it at all costs; and how caregiving is a double edge blade in that caregivers not only often give their life in service, but also often receive resentment in return.
That there is a lot of weight being carried
This collection of images made me think of this random "pictures" that people that have the time to walk and observe the common stumble upon to. for me this piece is really good representation of this random thing that you encounter and seem ordinary but you find a value as they coexist with constant demands of a practical world, that makes you question your talents and creativity. 
My favorite. It feels right at home because as latin people we are accostumed to this type of relations where one way or the other these women are household possesions where it is okay to order them around, give them commands, at times with love and respect and other times with frustration and low patience. And in any way, both are “ok” because at the end of the day this woman is your household possesion. She is friends with silence, she is always present but doesn’t have vote or voice in the house that is also her own, or at least her second home. 
The piece uses a "toy kitchen" as a metaphor for managing and suppressing emotions. It describes how the speaker deals with his/her feelings using inadequate tools sacrificing desires and self-esteem to conform to imposed norms and roles.. The poem reflects how a person adjusts their way of being to fit into societal expectations
A woman is a butcher who hacks away at the carcass of her wants, needs, wishes, dreams and more, in order to feed others and give them sustenance, to fuel the love and care given to them but is not reciprocated in the same or similar manner towards her.
It talks about adaptability and the  importance of change.
Every woman has being at some point 'my sister' - I feel that this could easily be a part of every woman's journey. To get a job for which she is more than qualified, but is judged mostly on her looks and the way she conducts and dresses herself. She's expected to be a 'sweetheart,' rather than being recognized as an intelligent and driven person.
This text explores the relationship between a privileged person and her 'nana,' who has been a constant presence throughout her life. Although the 'nana' means everything to her, she realizes she doesn’t truly know her. She wishes she had known her 'nana' better and could have shared moments in an environment where her 'nana' felt truly herself. The 'nana' is the most special, caring person who constantly gives, yet there’s never a moment for her to receive.
This seems to depict a mother who was dysfunctional in certain ways. Her daughters resent her for neglecting them, while her son resents her for spoiling him. And, as is often the case, it's the women who end up caring for the parents, even if one of them isn't actually their daughter. There's also a granddaughter, misnamed by her grandmother, who experiences the strange mix of pity and awkwardness toward a grandmother she didn't have much contact with, especially when her father seems to despise her. It's awkward to feel the stereotypical affection for a sweet old grandmother when there's underlying resentment and pity, and she likely despises her a bit too. 
This piece tells the story of a grand mother that took care of her son all her life, but does not receive any equivalent care from him when she gets older and needs it. Instead, his partner and his daughter are helping.
Heavy labour that is not valued, even ignored and taken for granted, at the cost of and against one's own happiness 
s
A woman that fell victim to societal and cultural beliefs where men need to be protected and cherished at all times, whether winter are capable of taking care of themselves in their development, to then grow to become the primary carer. The man is seen as god-like, almost, a precious resource to protect, whether the value and time of the female is too serve and elevate its counterpart. No character in this story has any choice. They all play the role that society and culture has laid out for them and when they do, the world sees them as the villain, the crazy and partisan mother, the callous and ungrateful son, the charitable and naive daughter in law, the inaccurately prepared granddaughter. It's a common script.
Sometimes we are not working or fighting for our dreams but for someone else´s dreams 
This piece talks about the kitchen and its default place in the kitchen, and through the kitchen it touches upon all of those sacrifices woman do daily in their work, family and personal lives to the cost of their own well being. It is anonymous and not as personal as some as the pieces but it felt like the story of millions or billions of woman now and in the past.
Women carry all the responsibility of taking care of relatives. 
How caregiving is a full time job that takes a lot of skills valued in the workforce that are always overseen by employers.
Go beyond your limits for others.
This is the story about a lady (luz) who has given away al her time to take care of others. she comes from a place were she dosen't belong to take care of this people that she initially didn't even know. A very common situation for latin counties.
This is a woman who sustains everybody else before herself. Feeling frustrated with everyday life bothers that she knows she has to do or else no body else will do it. She seems to be tired and not happy giving herself the time and space she needs for her well being. Yet she seems as a very generous and loving person, but not a happy or content one. She doesn’t feel that she is taken care of. 
I interpret that she is a woman who is tired of always giving to others, putting herself last, neglecting her own needs, and reaching a state of both emotional and physical exhaustion.
There is a vapid and empty nature to the ennui of modern life. The structures of work and community in modern society enable isolationism and loneliness.
That your body is for function and not for shaming
It's a powerful commentary on the lives of domestic workers and caregivers, who often dedicate themselves to supporting others while struggling to secure their own stability and sense of home.
What I understand from this text is that it tells the story of an overprotective mother whose excessive care for her son led him to be unwilling to care for her during her dementia. This frustration was passed down to her granddaughter, who, although not very fond of her grandmother, is scared of losing her. Ultimately, the daughter-in-law becomes the only one caring for her.
A do-it-all mom. A do-it-all care giver. A do it all person who has to be strong as a tree so everyone can lean on her, hang from her, use her for shade. As in the past pieces, there is also a shame component, guilt to feel what she feels and impossibility of asking for support. Asking to be held. 
This piece compares the mental load experienced by the author to kitchen tasks, traditionally expected from women in the household.
How someone else's sacrifices and labour are recognised, and wished for that they would make more for themselves instead of for others. That it would be easier to accept this persons caring love as a gift, if this person would care and love herself more, and sacrifice less for others. 
I think it is a curriculum of skills but the images show how this common descriptions apply more to objects and machines than to the people applying. It highlights the contradictions and impossible expectations.
The need for organization in an disorganized / clutter environment 
how difficult and not realistic it is to keep up with current demands of taking self of your self. How feeling accomplished makes your transpas meany of your personal limits, cause you justa have to keep on living and making thinks work. i think the way o doing it through the metaphor of the kitchen is interesting cause you have to eat, or you will not survive. 
This one confused me. It felt like an in between between grooming, harassment and being a stay at home mother.
It is a bit harder to understand, but it is a person who burned, giving all to others until she was hollow inside and became soulless. A person who is exploited, never good enough, meant to fit society no matter of her own wishes, formed into a shape she is not until she burned and became soulless. 
Women expected traditional role. There seem no way out.
The story behind privilege and underprivilege in countries that are so unequal like Colombia. I felt like so many people could dare to say "at least they have a job". 
I had difficulty getting into this piede. Maybe it's the lay out?
This is a beautiful collection of photos, but they don’t seem to fit the context of a job description for a position that's seeking candidates. Which I love, they look sunny and pretty and when you read, we can se a corporation asking people to be willing to go above and beyond for a company that doesn;t even belong to them.
