When I was still in China during my secondary school time, I already felt that when doing daily cleaning duty in the classroom, girls are more active and motivated.
Yes, I related to the information shown in the dashboards because it directly reflected the areas I’ve been working on. For example, the performance metrics aligned with the goals we set, and seeing the progress or setbacks gave me valuable insights into how my efforts are impacting the overall results.
I have also worked physically and struggled to get rightful payment because of unfair employers. This is a huge problem especially for big families where parents need to take care of their kids or elderly people.

I don’t relate to it yet but I do fear for the future especially once I have a family of my own and try to strategize how to outsource some household tasks
