Women are more engaged in care work and farming/food production globally compared to men.
From the data dashboards, I can see important information and trends at a glance. They show key metrics and patterns that help understand how things are going and where action might be needed.
There is not equality in many countries mostly based in Africa, where more and more women works in care often as not paid labour. This trend increase in most of those countires, resulting in even more financial GDP gap of unpaid careworkers. 
I understood that first of all, there's much more hours spend in general on unpaid carework, but what I found annoying, is the huge difference between women and men in this kind of things. Also, what the data dashboards show us is that this issue is not changing, and its even getting worst. 
Women spend high proportions of their day doing unpaid labour, this is not only bad for them but also for our overall economy and society. South America has a consistently high amount of informal care workers through the years. Most care workers are female. There is a lot of missing information for several countries through the years, this makes it difficult to understand the information.
The burden of unpaid work is greater for women than for men throughout the world. While some countries are making progress, in many developing nations, there seems to be little to no improvement. Care work which should be an essential aspect in human development (nurturing and raising future generations) is often undervalued compared to other types of work.  Even food production is done mostly by women. 
The dashboards paint a clear picture of the gender disparity in unpaid labor and care work across different countries. Women are overwhelmingly responsible for these roles, whether it's informal care work, volunteering, subsistence farming, or unpaid domestic labor. The data shows that this imbalance has persisted over time and has even worsened in certain areas, particularly since the pandemic.
This is raw data that you need to use in context as an example of each one of the periods that the dashboard are evaluating.
High woman inequality in the world
Although we seem to progress in terms of equal rights between men and women, the traditional model of women taking care of household chores and childcare persists 
Even though I knew that women have contributed nothing less to the world than men already, I still felt quite frustrated when seeing the actual data which is showing the fact that women are contributing more than men in care work, volunteering and farming(which is always recognised as heavy work) while a large percentage of men are still having the stereotype that women are not contributing as much as men.
Viewing these dashboards made me feel positive. The data was well-organized and easy to understand, which gave me confidence in our progress and helped me quickly identify areas for improvement.
Those dashboards made me realize that there is a huge problem with unpaid labor, mostly women who spend their time e.g. on care without any compensation. I have heard similar sad stories like slavery in cobalt mines, and I think those are emerging topics. If those countries want to grow their economy, they have to fight for equality and rightful compensation for work.
They make me feel frustrated and a little bit ashamed as a man, because it's very clear and obvious how unfair is the distribution of carework. Even it makes me feel mad, the natural feeling reaction is kind of neutral because it's not a surprise. I expected it. But with some dashboards I felt more disturbed than with others. The map, was the one which I connected the most.
Glad that this information exists and that the gap is so evident between males and females. Motivated to work to improve this. 
As a woman, it makes me feel frustrated and powerless.  Things should be equal between sexes. 
Viewing these dashboards stirred a sense of concern and frustration. The data highlights a persistent and significant gender inequality that affects women’s lives globally. It’s disheartening to see that despite progress in other areas, the burden of unpaid and informal labor continues to fall disproportionately on women, often without recognition or adequate support.
Unpaid labour has a strong impact in our economies. However, this situation put the women in a difficult situation compare with men which works in paid activities rather than unpaid. Inequality.

Negatively surprised 
When I was still in China during my secondary school time, I already felt that when doing daily cleaning duty in the classroom, girls are more active and motivated.
Yes, I related to the information shown in the dashboards because it directly reflected the areas I’ve been working on. For example, the performance metrics aligned with the goals we set, and seeing the progress or setbacks gave me valuable insights into how my efforts are impacting the overall results.
I have also worked physically and struggled to get rightful payment because of unfair employers. This is a huge problem especially for big families where parents need to take care of their kids or elderly people. Filling the gap of unpaid labor is crucial for stable and fair economic growth especially for people with many dependents.
All of them have to doo with unpaid work, and the amount of time spend on it.
This made me think of my experience as a volunteer, where most were men and yet apparently it's the only unpaid care work they are actually doing. Other than this, it seems academic and difficult to relate to. Perhaps it's too much information.
I live in a very sexist and misogynistic nation. Women are often undervalued and typically bear the responsibility for everything, including work, childcare, and household labor.  Men just go around making children and not having any responsibility. 
I can relate to the information in a broader social context. The issues highlighted in the dashboards reflect conversations that many of us are familiar with—whether it’s in our communities, families, or workplaces. It resonates with the experiences of women worldwide who juggle multiple responsibilities, often without the acknowledgment or resources they deserve. This is a reality that affects not just women but entire societies, as the value of this labor is essential yet undervalued.
Yes, I bring the concept of unpaid labor an their concept and use the metrics provided by the dashboards.
Yes. Women rights are undermined particularly in developing countries.
I don’t relate to it yet but I do fear for the future especially once I have a family of my own and try to strategize how to outsource some household tasks
