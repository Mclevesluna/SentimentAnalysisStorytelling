I understood the text describes a person who is burdened by her job in the kitchen, where her well-being, reasonable work hours, fair pay, and a healthy environment are neglected, with the sole focus on delivering results. She never stops, and even when she does, she can't engage in anything else due to the toll the job takes on her. 
The piece made me feel fortunate about my job and very frustrated knowing that some people have to work under such harsh conditions.
I didn't directly relate to the text but I felt the need to make my workplace a better place where no one feels this way. 

This text explores the relationship between a privileged person and her 'nana,' who has been a constant presence throughout her life. Although the 'nana' means everything to her, she realizes she doesn’t truly know her. She wishes she had known her 'nana' better and could have shared moments in an environment where her 'nana' felt truly herself. The 'nana' is the most special, caring person who constantly gives, yet there’s never a moment for her to receive.
It made me feel nostalgic and reflect on the people in my life who always give without expecting anything in return. I am very grateful for them and would love to be as much a part of their lives as they are of mine.
Yes a lot! It made me remember the people in my life to whom I feel grateful and how its always easier to give and very difficult to receive. It makes you think about the people that dedicate their lives to caring about others and sometimes they get lost and forget who they are.

What I understand from this text is that it tells the story of an overprotective mother whose excessive care for her son led him to be unwilling to care for her during her dementia. This frustration was passed down to her granddaughter, who, although not very fond of her grandmother, is scared of losing her. Ultimately, the daughter-in-law becomes the only one caring for her.
I feel frustrated because I feel it's a dilema between taking care for the woman who raised your father and not tolerating her. I don't know if I didn't understand the text but I felt it was a bit ungrateful. 
I don't feel at all related to this text. I am a very caring person with my grandparents and I would care for them forever, I am very grateful for them and wouldn't imagine having this dilema if I understood correctly.
