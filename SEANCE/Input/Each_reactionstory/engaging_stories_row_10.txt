The piece reflects a deep and familiar connection to the role that women like Luz play in many Latin households. It touches on the complex dynamics where these women are seen as essential yet often undervalued members of the family. Luz is a source of warmth, kindness, and light, despite the darker, colder environment she lives in. She is a constant presence, expected to fulfill her duties without much recognition or voice.
This piece brings up a lot of feelings. On one hand, it makes me feel warm and admire Luz for her kindness, dedication, and all the love she’s given. On the other hand, it makes me sad and uneasy because it shows how women like her often go unnoticed and are expected to stay in the background, without much recognition or a voice of their own. 
I relate to this text because I've had a similar relationship with the person who works in my home in Bogotá. She is someone who is always present in the family and whom we all care for deeply. I feel that she knows all of us very well and is truly a part of our home. However, in the end, we don’t really know her own reality. Someday, I would like to be able to visit her other home.

The piece uses a "toy kitchen" as a metaphor for managing and suppressing emotions. It describes how the speaker deals with his/her feelings using inadequate tools sacrificing desires and self-esteem to conform to imposed norms and roles.. The poem reflects how a person adjusts their way of being to fit into societal expectations
It’s frustrating and angering to see how the pressure to conform to societal expectations can lead to emotional strain and a sense of neglect, suppressing the true feelings and avoiding being authentic due to fear. 
Yes, I feel that we live in a society with certain standards that we think we must meet to be accepted. However, as I have grown, I have changed this perspective and believe that I am now more aware and honest with myself about my feelings, dreams, and thoughts, and ultimately more authentic in my way of being.

I interpret that she is a woman who is tired of always giving to others, putting herself last, neglecting her own needs, and reaching a state of both emotional and physical exhaustion.
It generates a negative reaction of fatigue, exhaustion, and self-neglect. Perhaps this person is very good to others but selfish with herself.
I believe there have been situations in my life or people with whom I have felt like this woman who feels responsible for carrying the weight of others. I don’t identify with her entirely, but I do think there have been times when, for one reason or another, I ended up putting others above myself, which can lead to harming oneself both physically and emotionally.
