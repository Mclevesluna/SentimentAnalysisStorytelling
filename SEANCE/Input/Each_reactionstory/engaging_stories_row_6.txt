How taxing giving care is on the caregiver by personifying the expectation that “women belong in the kitchen”
Thought it was shocking. Made me sad and angry, but also surprised at how well the author was able to convey such deep, sad emotions in such a seemingly delicate, cutesie way.
I thought about how I often took for granted stuff my mom did for me and my brother growing up, how taxing it must have been for her not only doing a job that society unfairly assigned to her and not my father, but also for not being properly thanked for it, or reciprocated for. 

How the burden of caregiving disproportionately falls on women; how men are not judged for avoiding it at all costs; and how caregiving is a double edge blade in that caregivers not only often give their life in service, but also often receive resentment in return.
Angry, mostly. Angry at the father who is unapologetic for avoiding to care for his own mother. Angry that the burden of this very important thing automatically fell on the women of the family. Empathetic towards the fear of having to take care of somebody. In awe of the stepmother who owned the job with love and grace.
Yes. Made me think of all the seemingly little things that my mom, or I, or my cousins have to do every day that men are not expected to. How when I stand up from the table I instinctively pick up my husbands or brothers or fathers plate, but seldom get mine picked up.

How caregiving is a full time job that takes a lot of skills valued in the workforce that are always overseen by employers.
Thought it was clever. Made me sad how deciding to be a stay at home mom for a while usually comes at the expense of a professional career, despite being probably the hardest job ever.
Just made me think about my mother-in-law, who is one of the smartest most go-getting person I know, but who decided to stay home and take care of her kids during their youth, is probably also the least employable person i know. Sad.
