Frustration with assigned / expected role. "Women belong in the kitchen"-
Negative. There seem to be no way out. No dreams are viable
As a woman who grew up up in the 60s, some  of that traditional roles were expected of you.

A nice woman who others depend on her. Her life seems to be that of service.
Positive. Although the contrast between dark and light, the story has a nice energy. Luz embodies those people we depende on through our lives. She seems to be content, but she is undervalued. 
It brings memories of women caretakers in my childhood.

Women carry all the responsibility of taking care of relatives. 
Upset at the lack of awareness / responsibility of the son towards this own family members.Taking women's role for granted, 
No

The need for organization in an disorganized / clutter environment 
Negative. I like structure, organized environments
I relate in the sense that if it was up to me, I would start decluttering and organizing.

Women expected traditional role. There seem no way out.
Negative. I found the story suffocating and frustrating

I had difficulty getting into this piede. Maybe it's the lay out?
I found it confusing. Didn't really understand it
no
