Luz is a woman who puts others before herself. She spreads herself thin, extending herself (branches of a tree) supporting others (the leaves) who can thus bud and grow, but does not give herself the support she needs from within (the tree).
Negative in the empathy I feel for someone like this, as I know people close to me in my life who exhibit this behaviour, but positive in the sense that it is a good reminder to take care of oneself and check in with yourself.
Yes, as my mom is someone who will spread herself thin in the way Luz does but does not do the things for herself that she does for others. 

A woman is a butcher who hacks away at the carcass of her wants, needs, wishes, dreams and more, in order to feed others and give them sustenance, to fuel the love and care given to them but is not reciprocated in the same or similar manner towards her.
Negative
In recognising the ways that the women in my life have tended to give more of themselves than they were to receive from others.

There is a vapid and empty nature to the ennui of modern life. The structures of work and community in modern society enable isolationism and loneliness.
Negative
YES. It amplifies the strong feelings I monitor of the inherent loneliness and destructive patterns that modern life enables and forces in the workplace, and that we as result carry out of the workplace. Donning a sort of mask that we must employ to trudge through the banalities of everyday working day life.
