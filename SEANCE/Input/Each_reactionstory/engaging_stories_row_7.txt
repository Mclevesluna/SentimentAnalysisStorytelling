From this piece I interpret how censored and repressed she is by not been able to be herself. 
It made me feel sorry for the person and angry at whatever is making her feel like this. 
I'm able to see the reality of a lot of people here. How we stop sharing our personality or really doing what we want based on what we have been taught are "the right things". 

That there is a lot of weight being carried
First it made me feel sad for her, but then it made me feel frustrated because most of her talk is negative and not being able to appreciate some of her body parts, .  
At first I did, but as I kept reading it made me feel like there was not a single thing that she appreciated creating a barrier to connect and relate to it.

Go beyond your limits for others.
It made me feel surprised and intrigued. Reading the text it felt like most of the companies requests for candidates. It made me wonder if I have ever done it, and if there has been a company that has done that for me.
I did. As I mentioned before this is what I have read in most job postings.
