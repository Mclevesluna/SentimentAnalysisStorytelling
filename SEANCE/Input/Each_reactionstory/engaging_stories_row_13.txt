I understand from the piece the immense burden women have to bear in life, how they have to share and give all that is theirs to others, especially if they have children. What resonates most shockingly is the line 'the sex that gives pleasure that is not always mine.' This statement is both true and harsh, highlighting the painful reality that women often prioritize others' needs and desires over their own.
The piece had a negative impact on me because it highlighted the stark reality of women's struggles, particularly in regards to their autonomy, desire, and bodily ownership. It's a harsh reminder of the societal expectations and pressures that women face, and the ways in which their needs and desires are often marginalized or ignored.
I find the text relatable as I'm at a critical stage in my life where I'm faced with societal pressures and biological deadlines. The struggle to balance my personal aspirations with external expectations is a constant dilemma. I often find myself torn between pursuing my career goals and contemplating the sacrifices I'm willing to make for my future. The text resonates with me because it echoes my own internal conflicts and forces me to confront the tough decisions I need to make about my priorities and values.

Every woman has being at some point 'my sister' - I feel that this could easily be a part of every woman's journey. To get a job for which she is more than qualified, but is judged mostly on her looks and the way she conducts and dresses herself. She's expected to be a 'sweetheart,' rather than being recognized as an intelligent and driven person.
I feel frustrated by this piece, not due to the experiences, but because she appears to lack the empowerment to speak up and advocate for herself. It's troubling to witness her life passing by without her expressing her own needs and desires
I relate to this text because I've heard the phrase 'You should feel honored to work here' in the past. At the time, I didn't speak up and express my thoughts, instead choosing to continue with my job. In hindsight, I wish I had spoken up, as it's important to assert oneself and address potentially toxic workplace dynamics

It's a powerful commentary on the lives of domestic workers and caregivers, who often dedicate themselves to supporting others while struggling to secure their own stability and sense of home.
Reading this piece evoked a strong negative emotional response in me. I felt a deep sense of discomfort, sadness, and guilt. The vivid portrayal of Luz's isolation and exploitation hit close to home, as I recognized the harsh reality of societal norms that perpetuate such injustices in Colombia. The knowledge that I am part of a society that has normalized and tolerated this kind of treatment towards domestic workers like Luz filled me with regret and frustration. The text's honest depiction of her loneliness and disempowerment made me question my own complicity, leaving me feeling somber and reflective.
I deeply relate to this text because I have my own 'Luz' in Elvi, who raised me from birth until I left my parents house at 26. Elvi, who has no biological children, has been like a mother to me, and I'm her only 'daughter.' Now retired in Zipaquira, she visits me monthly. However, I often wonder what Elvi's life would be like if she had access to equal opportunities and a chance at a better future. This text resonates with me as I reflect on Elvi's sacrifices, dedication, and the what-ifs of her life.
