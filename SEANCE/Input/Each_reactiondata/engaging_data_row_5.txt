Women spend high proportions of their day doing unpaid labour, this is not only bad for them but also for our overall economy and society. South America has a consistently high amount of informal care workers through the years. Most care workers are female. There is a lot of missing information for several countries through the years, this makes it difficult to understand the information.
Glad that this information exists and that the gap is so evident between males and females. Motivated to work to improve this. 
This made me think of my experience as a volunteer, where most were men and yet apparently it's the only unpaid care work they are actually doing. Other than this, it seems academic and difficult to relate to. Perhaps it's too much information.
