There is not equality in many countries mostly based in Africa, where more and more women works in care often as not paid labour. This trend increase in most of those countires, resulting in even more financial GDP gap of unpaid careworkers. 
Those dashboards made me realize that there is a huge problem with unpaid labor, mostly women who spend their time e.g. on care without any compensation. I have heard similar sad stories like slavery in cobalt mines, and I think those are emerging topics. If those countries want to grow their economy, they have to fight for equality and rightful compensation for work.
I have also worked physically and struggled to get rightful payment because of unfair employers. This is a huge problem especially for big families where parents need to take care of their kids or elderly people. Filling the gap of unpaid labor is crucial for stable and fair economic growth especially for people with many dependents.
