The burden of unpaid work is greater for women than for men throughout the world. While some countries are making progress, in many developing nations, there seems to be little to no improvement. Care work which should be an essential aspect in human development (nurturing and raising future generations) is often undervalued compared to other types of work.  Even food production is done mostly by women. 
As a woman, it makes me feel frustrated and powerless.  Things should be equal between sexes. 
I live in a very sexist and misogynistic nation. Women are often undervalued and typically bear the responsibility for everything, including work, childcare, and household labor.  Men just go around making children and not having any responsibility.
