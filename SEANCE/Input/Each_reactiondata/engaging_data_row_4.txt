I understood that first of all, there's much more hours spend in general on unpaid carework, but what I found annoying, is the huge difference between women and men in this kind of things. Also, what the data dashboards show us is that this issue is not changing, and its even getting worst. 
They make me feel frustrated and a little bit ashamed as a man, because it's very clear and obvious how unfair is the distribution of carework. Even it makes me feel mad, the natural feeling reaction is kind of neutral because it's not a surprise. I expected it. But with some dashboards I felt more disturbed than with others. The map, was the one which I connected the most.
All of them have to doo with unpaid work, and the amount of time spend on it.
