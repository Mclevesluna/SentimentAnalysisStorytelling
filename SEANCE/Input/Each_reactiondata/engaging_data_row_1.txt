Women are more engaged in care work and farming/food production globally compared to men.
Even though I knew that women have contributed nothing less to the world than men already, I still felt quite frustrated when seeing the actual data which is showing the fact that women are contributing more than men in care work, volunteering and farming(which is always recognised as heavy work) while a large percentage of men are still having the stereotype that women are not contributing as much as men.
When I was still in China during my secondary school time, I already felt that when doing daily cleaning duty in the classroom, girls are more active and motivated.
