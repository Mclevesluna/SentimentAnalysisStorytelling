Did you relate to this text in any way? If so, please explain how:

It reminds me of my grandmother, Tita, and the contempt my father had for her. In my father’s family, people would often call me by the wrong name, confusing me with my older sister, because we rarely saw them. I understand the awkwardness of feeling affection for someone like a grandmother when your parents hold them in contempt. How can you not learn to despise certain things when you see your parents despise their own?

This also resonates with the idea of burdens being passed down and the typical male inability to fully assume caregiving responsibilities, often shifting them onto a woman—whether it's a daughter, wife, or mother.

My dad wasn’t speaking to my grandmother when she died, and she passed away feeling very sad because her youngest son, out of eight children, had abandoned her. Now, I find myself caring for my father, who not only abandoned his own mother but also my mother, sister, and me. Yet, he never acknowledges this abandonment, though he occasionally recognizes that I’ve been supporting him for the past 10 years.

I now have a close relationship with my dad's sisters, whom he no longer speaks to either. (He fights with everyone and resents everyone, including me.) It was they who told me that my dad was the light of my grandmother's eyes, that she never laid a hand on him, and that she loved and pampered him dearly. I have never once heard this from my dad himself.

And a tragicomic story to finalize this:

When my grandmother died and was cremated, my dad was the one carrying the little box with her ashes after the mass. I honestly thought, ""WTF? You didn't speak to her for years, resented everything she did, and now you're the one who gets to carry her in your lap in a taxi to my aunt's house?""

When she died, I didn't even know what to feel. I felt sad, but I also felt I didn’t have the right to feel sad because I hadn’t called or visited her as much. We weren’t super close, and I was so biased by my dad's perception that I felt guilty. I think women are great at feeling guilty. Do men feel guilty as often? I honestly doubt it.",My Body,"A do-it-all mom. A do-it-all care giver. A do it all person who has to be strong as a tree so everyone can lean on her, hang from her, use her for shade. As in the past pieces, there is also a shame component, guilt to feel what she feels and impossibility of asking for support. Asking to be held. ","I felt empathy and it makes we wonder if I feel like that often and I'm not a mom, how can mom's and care-takers manage?",This makes me wonder if men ever feel this way? Do they carry this much emotion? Do they feel this guilty when they think about their needs? Is it a female thing to be unable to ask for what makes you feel good and safe?,My Sister,"This one confused me. It felt like an in between between grooming, harassment and being a stay at home mother.","Honestly, I felt confused. I felt like someone that has too many thoughts at once was putting them all quickly on paper.",I could with certain sentences. Like I read and could relate to parts but not as much as the previous ones.,"SHE, THE LIGHT","The story behind privilege and underprivilege in countries that are so unequal like Colombia. I felt like so many people could dare to say ""at least they have a job"". ",I felt embarrassed. I find it so embarrassing to have this kind of labor in Colombia and most people think it's normal. I also felt love because this women who raised us can be the most loving ever. But I got to be raised by someone else's mother who didn't get to raise her own children and she had to work far away form home so she could pay for someone else to take care of her kids. It's very messed up. ,"Completely. Im also Colombian, and I also had a beautiful Luz in my life. Actually two. One even slept in my house from Sunday to Saturday.

This also makes me think of the people that take care of kids in order to pay someone to take care of their kids. I grew up like this (me being one of the privileged kids that was always being taken care of) and sometimes questioning where were the families of the loving people that took care of me? As I grew started growing up, this became an awkward feeling so I moved on to think of other things. I felt guilty and sorry for them. 

I’m also embarassed to accept that once, a German guy said that we had modern slavery in Colombia because we have maids and servants, he used those words (in my defense, he had a horrible attitude and he spoke with a lot of superiority). I told him he didn’t understand, he hadn’t lived there, and that the compromise behind this is helping their families and giving them opportunities for the later generations to have more decent jobs. I can’t believe I actually thought it was normal and a “job” for a person to take care of me 14/7. Sleep in my house. Cook my food, play with me, take my dog out to the park, clean the whole house, love me, mediate in my fights with my sister, make sure I wouldn’t watch tv when my mom wasn’t around. I would even go sleep in her bed and wake her up when I had nightmares and my mom told me to go back to my bed. How in the world do we normalize this?",To Whom it May Concern,"This is a beautiful collection of photos, but they don’t seem to fit the context of a job description for a position that's seeking candidates. Which I love, they look sunny and pretty and when you read, we can se a corporation asking people to be willing to go above and beyond for a company that doesn;t even belong to them.",Loved it. Beautiful pictures. It felt like a short documentary. I felt angry because I feel angry everytime big companies talk about ownership but I think they don't do reverse ownership. We as employees are so easy to replace. ,"I like analogue photos, I also really like the colors. I like everyday empty sets. This are the kind of photos I like to take and I hate that companies want ownership from us. "
8/31/2024 20:59:28,Yes,"A Toy Kitchen, My Body, Crazy Nana Jean",My Body,"It is depicting work often expected from women in their social life, and associating it with parts of their body. Doing so, the piece emphasizes how their whole being is dedicated to others and performing tasks that are often not acknowledged, appreciated and rewarded.","This piece made me feel sorry for people experiencing this, and worried I may have contributed to it.","This made me question whether I experienced what this piece represents, from both sides of the relationship.",Crazy Nana Jean,"This piece tells the story of a grand mother that took care of her son all her life, but does not receive any equivalent care from him when she gets older and needs it. Instead, his partner and his daughter are helping.","This piece made me feel sorry for Crazy Nana Jean, angry at her son for his ungrateful behavior.","This piece made me consider my own relationship with my family, and the fact that I do not take care of my parents and grand parents as much as they took care of me during my whole childhood. I live far from them and am not very present, especially to help my grand mother who is aging and experience difficulties to move.",A Toy Kitchen,"This piece compares the mental load experienced by the author to kitchen tasks, traditionally expected from women in the household.","This piece made me empathize with the author, and sorry that they are carrying so much burden and no receiving back similar help.","This piece made me wonder whether people experience similar unfairness in my relatives, and what I should do to support them the same way they support me.",,,,,,,,,,,,
9/3/2024 11:13:37,Yes,"SHE, THE LIGHT, A Toy Kitchen, My Sister, My Body",My Body,"Being caught inside a body that is not yours anymore, but others ","It made me feel uncomfortable and disconnected, and also a bit guilty. 
Uncomfortable, because it should not be, that a person does not own their own body for themselves, a body which actually is owned, ruled, driven and governed by others (other peoples needs), ignoring the persons own needs. It's like not existing for yourself. 
Disconnected, because it is hard to relate to the persons position. 
And guilty, because I can not relate, because this should not be, I should do something against this, but I am not, and I would not know how to. ",No,A Toy Kitchen,"Heavy labour that is not valued, even ignored and taken for granted, at the cost of and against one's own happiness ","It made me feel sorry and angry. 
This should not be, a persons work should be recognised, even valued, especially when it becomes such a sacrifice to this persons own wishes. I want this person's labour to be recognised. I do not understand why this work is not recognised! Why is society like this, why do we not all take care of each other amongst us

","No, but it reminds me of my mother a little bit. The endless work and love she spends every single day, from since I was a baby and even still today, she is helping me with so many things, she cooks for the entire family, and for way too long I took her care and labour for granted. Only since I became more adult I understand how much work and time she sacrificed for our family, and I started to become very grateful of this. ","SHE, THE LIGHT","How someone else's sacrifices and labour are recognised, and wished for that they would make more for themselves instead of for others. That it would be easier to accept this persons caring love as a gift, if this person would care and love herself more, and sacrifice less for others. ","It made me feel a little bit sad, but overall I feel not as negative as towards the other stories in this one. 
I am glad, that the writer recognised the carers labour and sacrifices, and also their circumstances of living. It is humane of the writer to wish for this person to have more of their own life, instead of sacrificing it all for others. I see that the writer sees the carer on an equal level of him/herself, more as a friend, and not on a lower level or as a servant. 
But it makes me sad, that this wish does not seem to become true, of both of them being equal. ","I can relate somehow, since I've been to Colombia myself and stayed with wealthy families, who all had a maid to clean and cook for them. Those maids that I met were extremely loving and caring, but I do not know under which circumstances they actually live, and how they are managing to have their own family to take care of plus another persons family at the same time. I also do not know how well they are paid, and how valued and appreciated their work is with the families they help in. ",My Sister,"It is a bit harder to understand, but it is a person who burned, giving all to others until she was hollow inside and became soulless. A person who is exploited, never good enough, meant to fit society no matter of her own wishes, formed into a shape she is not until she burned and became soulless. ","It makes me angry that society is trying to put their ideals onto others, regardless of that this person for themselves might want. Especially in this male dominated context, ""you should wear make-up; who will marry you"", and seing her as an object rather than the person she is. ","Yes. I can relate to the feeling of never being good enough for someone, also for the people that are closest to you. I can relate how this burns you out from inside until you become empty, and fall into a deep dark hole of depression, because I experienced both these things, too. I can relate to how she is given stupid tasks like counting pages; I can relate to how she is being objectified, as I was, too, in the past. ",,,,,,,,
